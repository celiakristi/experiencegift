Before compiling, install the emoji picker first:


`npm install vanilla-emoji-picker`



Note:

This project is not quite finished yet.
What needs to be done:

- Styling of the form
- Finding another emoji picker because this picker has no custom logic to detect event (choosing emoji, opening picker, closing picker)


If there's any question, feel free to contact me!


Enjoy!
